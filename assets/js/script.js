//TO DO
// HOW TO FIX HTML / CSS SO BUTTON IS ON NEXT ROW AND SAME WIDTH AS INPUT BOX
// Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
// When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
// When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
// The city name - city.name OR $("#search-input").val()
// The date - list[0].dt_txt
// An icon representation of weather conditions - list[0].weather[0].icon
// The temperature - list[0].main.temp
// The humidity - list[0].main.humidity is humidity in the current next 3 hr slot
// The wind speed - list[0].wind.speed

// When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
// The date
// An icon representation of weather conditions
// The temperature
// The humidity
// When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

//list[0] is midnight, [1] is 3am, [2] is 6am etc. 5 day, 3 hour forecast data starting from next 3rd hour slot
